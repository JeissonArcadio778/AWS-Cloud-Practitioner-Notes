☁️ AWS Cloud Practitioner - Practical Study Notes (Obsidian Vault)

Hi! This repository contains my personal study notes for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) certification.

I built this material using Obsidian because it allowed me to connect concepts, include diagrams, and document real-world use cases in a non-linear way. This approach helped me move past simple memorization to actually understanding how the AWS ecosystem works.

🗂️ Content Structure
The vault is organized following the exam domains and my own deep-dive sessions:

- 01-03: Fundamentals & IAM – Introduction to Cloud Computing and identity security.

- 04-05: Compute & Networking (EC2, ELB, ASG) – Detailed notes on instances, load balancers, and high availability (including Sticky Sessions and ENI).

- 06-08: Storage & Databases – Comparisons between S3 (versioning, storage classes), RDS, Aurora, and DynamoDB.

- 10-12: Infrastructure as Code & Deployment – Insights into CloudFormation, CDK, Beanstalk, and the CodePipeline suite.

- 13-14: Global Infrastructure & Advanced Security – Route 53, CloudFront, WAF, Shield, and compliance tools like AWS Artifact.

- 15-17: Billing & Migration – AWS Pricing models, the Well-Architected Framework, and cloud migration strategies.
